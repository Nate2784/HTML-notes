## 1, (****`<cite>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<p>David Allen's breakthrough organization book <cite>Getting Things Done</cite> has taken the web by storm.</p>
```

## 2, (****`<optgroup>`****)

The `<optgroup>` tag is a great way to add a little definition between groups of options inside a select box. This allows the select list to visually separate the items.

If you needed to group movie listings by time, for example, then it would look like this:

```html
<label for="showtimes">Showtimes</label>
<select id="showtimes" name="showtimes"> 
    <optgroup label="1PM">
        <option value="titanic">Twister</option> 
        <option value="nd">Napoleon Dynamite</option> 
        <option value="wab">What About Bob?</option> 
    </optgroup> 
    <optgroup label="2PM">
        <option value="bkrw">Be Kind Rewind</option> 
        <option value="stf">Stranger Than Fiction</option> 
    </optgroup> 
</select>
```

## 3, (****`<acronym>`****)

The `<acronym>` is one of those cool HTML tags you can use to define or further explain a group of words. When you hover over text that has the `<acronym>` tag used, a box appears below with the text from the title tag. For example:

```html
<p>The microblogging site <acronym title="Founded in 2006"> Twitter</acronym> has recently struggled with downtimes.</p>
```

## 4, (****`<address>`****)

The `<address>` tag is quite a little tag, but that doesn't mean it isn't useful! As the name implies, `<address>` allows you to semantically mark up addresses in HTML. The nifty little tag will also italicize all of the data within the brackets, though the style can easily be changed through simple CSS. allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<address>Glen Stansberry
1234 Web Dev Lane
Anywhere, USA
</address>
```

## 5, (****`<label>`****)

Form elements seem the easiest to forget when marking up a document. Of the form elements, one of the most forgotten is the `<label>` tag. Not only is it a quick way to note the label's text, but the `<label>` tag can also pass a "for" attribute to specify which element is to be given the label. These `<label>` tags are great for styling, and they also allow you to make the caption clickable for the associated element.

```html
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input id="username" type="text" />
```

## 6, (****`<progress>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

The HTML `< progress>` tag is used to show how far work has progressed. It makes it simple for web developers to add a progress bar to their website. It could also be used to represent the competence level of a developer's skill on their portfolio website or the progress of a file uploading with the `<progress>` tag. This may belong to the common HTML tags most people know about, but it deserves a spot on this list.

The max attribute specifies the range of the progress bar.

```html
<progress value="750" max="1000">
  <span>70</span>%
</progress>
```

## 7, **File Path Examples**

- The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page

```html
<img src="picture.jpg">
```

- The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder

```html
<img src="images/picture.jpg">
```

- The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web

```html
<img src="/images/picture.jpg">
```

- The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder

```html
<img src="../picture.jpg">
```

## 8, **HTML Links - Syntax**

- The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

```html
<a href="url">link text</a>
```

- example

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
```

# HTML Links - The target Attribute

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The `target` attribute can have one of the following values:

- `_self` - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
- `_blank` - Opens the document in a new window or tab
- `_parent` - Opens the document in the parent frame
- `_top` - Opens the document in the full body of the window

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
```

## 9, **HTML Iframe Syntax**

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

The HTML `<iframe>` tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

```html
<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>
```

### Iframe - Set Height and Width

Use the `height` and `width` attributes to specify the size of the iframe.

The height and width are specified in pixels by default:

```html
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="height:200px;width:300px;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
```

### **Iframe - Remove the Border**

By default, an iframe has a border around it.

To remove the border, add the `style` attribute and use the CSS `border` property:

```html
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:none;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
```

## 10, **The <div> Element**

The `<div>` element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

The `<div>` element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

```html
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Oslo</h2>
  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
  <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Rome</h2>
  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
  <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
```

## 11, **HTML Forms**

![Untitled](web%20tech%2049550502a4274e189150f94f11fe76df/Untitled.png)

# Checkboxes

The `<input type="checkbox">` defines a **checkbox**.

Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

```html
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
  <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
  <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
</form>
```

# The Submit Button

The `<input type="submit">` defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's `action` attribute.

# Example

A form with a submit button:

```html
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## 12, (****`<optgroup>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<p>David Allen's breakthrough organization book <cite>Getting Things Done</cite> has taken the web by storm.</p>
```

## 13, (****`<optgroup>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<p>David Allen's breakthrough organization book <cite>Getting Things Done</cite> has taken the web by storm.</p>
```

## 14, (****`<optgroup>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<p>David Allen's breakthrough organization book <cite>Getting Things Done</cite> has taken the web by storm.</p>
```

## 15, (****`<optgroup>`****)

allows you to define the text inside the element as a reference.

```html
<p>David Allen's breakthrough organization book <cite>Getting Things Done</cite> has taken the web by storm.</p>
```

The `for` attribute of the `<label>` tag should be equal to the `id` attribute of the `<input>` element to bind them together.

# Radio Buttons

The `<input type="radio">` defines a radio button.

Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.

```html
<p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p>

<form>
  <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" value="HTML">
  <label for="html">HTML</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS">
  <label for="css">CSS</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="javascript" name="fav_language" value="JavaScript">
  <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label>
</form>
```

The `<label>` element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the `<label>` element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The `<label>` element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.

The `<label>` tag defines a label for many form elements.

Notice the use of the `<label>` element in the example above.

**Note:** The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width of an input field is 20 characters.

```html
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form>
```

A form with input fields for text:

# Example

The `<input type="text">` defines a single-line input field for text input.

# Text Fields

All the different input types are covered in this chapter: [HTML Input Types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <input type="text"> | Displays a single-line text input field |
| <input type="radio"> | Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices) |
| <input type="checkbox"> | Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices) |
| <input type="submit"> | Displays a submit button (for submitting the form) |
| <input type="button"> | Displays a clickable button |

Here are some examples:

An `<input>` element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the `type` attribute.

The HTML `<input>` element is the most used form element.

All the different form elements are covered in this chapter: [HTML Form Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp).

The `<form>` element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

```html
<form>.*form elements*.</form>
```

The HTML `<form>` element is used to create an HTML form for user input:
